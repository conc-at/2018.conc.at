Mike is an independent web developer from Australia who has worked on some of Australia’s largest websites as well as some of the smallest community sites. When he’s not building websites or writing about building websites, he likes to experiment with code. Mike loves learning new things and finding techniques that challenge what we think is best practice. When he’s not exploring the digital landscape, he likes to explore the world. Currently trying to find a way to do both those things at the same time.
